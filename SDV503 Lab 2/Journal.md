<h2>What is the key difference between var let and const?</h2>

The keyword var declares variables globally or in function scoped. Var variables can be reassigned countless times by re-declaring the variable. While the let variable is limited to only block scopes such as IF statements. You can not declare let globally like var. You can not redeclare a let variable like you can var variable. You can update the let variable though. const variable is just like let in almost everyway except with const does not allow you to re-declarable or re-assignable a variable.
